Our customer has supplied us with the file cats_dogs.txt (Initial Data)

We need to design a site that has three (3) html files that will be:
- index.html, displays all the cats
- cats.html, displays all the cats (same as index.html)
- dogs.html, displays all the dogs

The html files must be designed with Bootstrap.
Also all the html files need to run an AJAX query that read a local JSON file (all_cats_dogs.json) with data.
These html files display the cats and dogs respectively. It would be nice if on these html files the customer can have a slider / carousel UI to each cat/dog.

This local JSON file is exported from a Java console application which reads the customer's file (cats_dogs.txt) and inserts in to a database all the data.

Later this Java console application exports from the database to another local file all_cats_dogs.json all the data from the database in a JSON form.
